The class Parameters contains all physical parameters for one zone (flow type
and reach) of the domain, namely :
    
    - area of the zone [L^2]
    - dispersivity     [L^2 / T], the dispersivity is considered constant
    - exchange rates   [??], the exchange rate is generated by the method setAlpha
it relates 2 zones
    - Degradation rate [??], the degradation rate is considered constant
    - Lateral flow loss [??], in/outflow of the domain
    - Lateral concentration [CU], equilibrium concentration constraining the
in/out flow
